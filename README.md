# batFramework

Welcome to the `batFramework`. This README provides an overview of the game framework.

## batFramework

The `batFramework` is a Python game development framework based on pygame, designed to streamline the process of creating 2D games. It provides a set of tools and components to handle scenes, transitions, cutscenes, audio, sprites, and more. The framework is built with flexibility in mind, allowing you to focus on game design while abstracting away low-level details.

### Features

- Scene management
- Cutscene support
- Audio management (music and sound effects with volume control)
- Entity, sprite, and animated sprite handling
- Transition effects
- Utility modules (time management, constants, etc.)
- No external dependency except for pygame

###  Explore batFramework

1. Install Python (version 3.11 or higher) and the latest stable version of pygame-ce.
2. Clone or download this repository.
4. Explore the framework's modules in the `batFramework` directory and integrate them into your own game project.

For more detailed information on how to use the framework, refer to the documentation (if available) or explore the source code in the `batFramework` directory.
